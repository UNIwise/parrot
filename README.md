Parrot the [POEditor](http://poeditor.com/) pull-through cache.

This cache makes it possible to pull app translations directly from [POEditor](http://poeditor.com/) instead of compiling them into your app. This means no more re-builds every time translations are updated!

# Features

-   **Cache choices**: Parrot comes with a Filesystem and Redis cache to facilitate single app deployments and highly distributed deployments.
-   **OpenAPI**: The Parrot API has been documented in OpenAPI specification which can be found in the [doc/](/docs) directory.
